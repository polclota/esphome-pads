ESPHome keypad (work in progress).

Works in combination with appdemon to process key presses as well as Nuki codes.

It is intended to be used with more than one keypad so each one may have its own code and key configuration. 

Requires Keypad_I2C library to function.

So, copy Keypad_I2C directory to every keypad lib directory.

Also, included pcb designs.

Enjoy!
